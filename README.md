Recursion

# NOTE
We will only be using recursion for solutions, it is a better programming technique and is an industry standard. Some programs may not contain recursion as it would be easier to write.

Please DO NOT use namespace std at all costs, it makes your code hard to read

# COMPILING
For the unitiated, this is on a Linux platform / Mac OS if toolchain is properly installed
```bash
clang++ -std=c++14 [input].cpp -o output
```
